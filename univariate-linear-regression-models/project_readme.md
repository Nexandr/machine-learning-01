My first ML project I think?

Its just a simple single variable linear regression model I made when I first discovered what gradient descent meant. Apparently you can use vectorization but I did not understand how that worked so I did it using iterative algebra.

Update: added a vectorization version as well yippie

## What does this code do?
takes a series of (x,y) pairs, learning rate, and iterations to be done, trains itself on that data for said amount of iterations, is able to predict the values of other data

## What libraries does it use?
only numpy. it has matplotlib but the matplotlib code is commented out i couldnt debug it

## How to run it?
python
